# Flask Scikit Learn - ML API Dev
A collection of API's developed in conjunction with blog posts to outline the ease and effectiveness of deploying ML models with Flask Applications. This is a series of tutorials where the design of the API will build out to be robust and distributed. Please check out the blog posts for corresponding documentation.

Please note that the version of python that I am using is 3.6.3. See individual versions requirements.txt files for specific dependancy versions.
